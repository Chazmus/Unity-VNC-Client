# Unity-VNC-Client

Unity 3D Vnc Client : Port of the VncSharp: A .NET VNC Client Library 
to Unity 3D

There is still some trouble with keys but as my main purpose is to integrate it into vr (without keyboard), I've let this buggy section as it.
The original code has been simplified because there is only one mode of view (no scaling or clipped).

Use the TestMouse scene to have a try.
I've tested using tightVNC client under windows.
